/*
  streamifier is a simple Node.js utility library that converts Buffers (and Strings) into readable streams.

  In your application, when you use Multer with Memory Storage, the uploaded file is loaded completely into your server's RAM as a raw Buffer (req.file.buffer). However, cloud services like Cloudinary require a streaming data source (ReadableStream) to accept files efficiently without crashing your server. streamifier bridges this gap.

  Why do we need it?

  Without it: You would have to save the file onto your server's hard drive first, read it using Node's fs.createReadStream(), upload it to Cloudinary, and then remember to delete the local file.

  With it: The file stays entirely in RAM, turns into a stream on the fly, and sends directly to Cloudinary. It is much faster and doesn't pollute your server's hard drive.

  npm install streamifier
  npm install --save-dev @types/streamifier
